Yet another To Do application

## Introduction
Yup. Another To Do application. Well, I basically want to learn Python and mess around with a NoSQL database.
So I thought to myself: Why not build a To Do app?
Nothing fancy... Or maybe it is? We'll see about that ;)

## Requirements
- Python 2.7.2 (http://www.python.org/)
- CouchDB 1.31 (http://couchdb.apache.org/)
- Django 1.5.1 (https://www.djangoproject.com/)
- couchdbkit (http://couchdbkit.org/)
